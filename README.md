# Motion Planning of Mobile Robot in Dynamic Obstacle Environment

**Problem Statement** : To implement Centralized and Decentralized approaches to multi agent path finding for different types of multi agent environment.


# Centralized Approach

### Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP)

# Decentralized Approach

### Non-Linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)

### Future Work
* A possible interesting future work can be to explore hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both centralized and decentralized methods
* We could use a centralized method for high level planning and a decentralized method for low level control This could potentially provide the best of both worlds optimal solutions and scalability
